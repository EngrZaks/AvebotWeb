hello guys! this is the repo for our website project.
the "design" folder is for Aisha and her group.

In agreement with what some of the guys (Dee & Kazeem) have suggested,
I have decided to allow for different independent entries for each
front end developer to work seperately on the design and push
his/her work. Let see the ideas.

if you are up for this challange, please fork the repo, create
your own project folder, work on it and make pull request, or let
me know.    Please just let me know either ways
